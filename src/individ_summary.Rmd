This study seeks to determine the effect of a treatment on reducing mental distress over time. Subjects provided information on their mental distress, gender, and education through a self-report questionnaire. Mixed-effects models found a significant decrease in mental distress over time across all subjects. No significant difference in mental distress was found between treatment and control groups. Results were limited by missing data and violations of model assumptions.
